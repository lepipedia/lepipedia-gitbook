| Question                                                    | Category         | Decision                                                                                                               |

| When will the migration happen?                             | Migration Timing | Not urgent, we will take our time picking the best solution                                                            |
| LEP force mint                                              | Minting          | It is too strong of an ability, we will disallow it.                                                                   |
| Will the Token IDs be clean (0, 1, 2)?                      | Minting          | ONGOING - MWSTW had an idea regarding maintaining the current Token IDs, saving gas in multiple areas.                 |
| Airdrop or burn-to-mint?                                    | Minting          | We are currently investigating "burn-to-mint" or "2-way portal"/wrapping approaches.                                   |
| Will Migrated LEPs have attributes?                         | Art/metadata     | LEP- "all 1/1, no traits." There may be unofficial ways to check traits (other website etc).                           |
| Will the art be changeable on the new contract?             | Art/metadata     | At first yes, with a flexible renderer to allow for many options. We can add a "LOCK" option that only LEP can invoke. |
| Will the tokens be ERC20 (Punks)/ERC721 (with newest code)? | Contract         | ONGOING                                                                                                                |
