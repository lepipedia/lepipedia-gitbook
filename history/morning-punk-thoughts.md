# Morning punk thoughts

Morning punk thoughts - might seem obvious to you but took me a while to think that clearly&#x20;



## Low effort punks&#x20;



**For Artists/ Creators** :art:: You don’t need money to start. You don’t need to have an exceptional technique. You can start from nothing thanks to blockchain & NFTs. Everyone can be an artist.&#x20;



**For Collectors** :handbag:: « What if ? » Paradigm / an ode to the 2021 hyperspeculation. What if this ? What if that ? What if your creator just said « Hi » for a year ? But he promised lambos ?? Wtf ??&#x20;

Well, it doesn’t really matter - low effort punk is a reflection on the inner agent that we all have within us. Do you really like the art ? Yes ? Ok let’s see how long you can hold this … can you hold it through 2021/ 2022/ 2023 / 2024 … and more ? Or will you think « ok wtf lep you promised lambo » I’m dumping right now. For the space :

* Low Effort Punk is a message of total freedom/ anti establishment from trad and crypto art
* Low Effort Punks is an ode to the project that started it all (crypto punks) with a similar derivatives potential // turn everything low effort
* Low effort punks encapsulates all the crap that was released between crypto punks and now with a gradual release during the pump and dump years.
* Low effort punks is a reflection on the notion of community & NFTs. Kindness is a key component
* Low effort punk is a reflection on the link between Life & Art & having fun.
* Low effort is a concept / that requires a ton of focus and understanding of intentions and inner self - also a lot of work. But it doesn’t have to look super complicated. Genius has the fewest moving parts.
