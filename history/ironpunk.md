# #IRONPUNK

\[IRONPUNK] provides for a stark contrast to the languid pace of minting, the anarchic attitude underpinning LEPâ€™s approach to creation. The #IRONPUNK era highlights the dedication required to maintain a consistent approach and aesthetic sensibility for as long as he has, while others chase trends. Truly remarkable to witness. **-BoomBoomNFT**&#x20;

**IRONPUNK started on Sept 19 following a sudden OpenSea announcement of the sunsetting of their Lazy Mint, which LEP was using at the time to make PUNK. He ran for glory basically.**

**first 1 ETH of LEP sales was sept 19 so thats when he decided to start IRONPUNK god mode challenge**
